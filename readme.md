# IMPORTANT #

[H5ON is about to undergo a major refactor](https://github.com/nrkn/h5on/issues/1) in the next day or so.

# H5ON (HTML5 Object Notation)

H5ON is an object notation, like [JSON](http://json.org), for representing objects as [HTML5](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/) elements.

This [working prototype](h5on.js) is implemented as a [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) plugin and is less than 2KB minified and gzipped.

It came out of a thought experiment with two goals in mind:

1. Traverse a JavaScript object graph using jQuery
2. The notation itself is rendered by layout engines in a human readable format

As this is the fruit of a thought experiment, please be aware that there are many alternative ways to traverse object graphs, and that for the most part they are much saner than this one. You have been warned!

Despite that caveat, you can do some interesting and powerful things using this approach. jQuery is a sophisticated traversal library and contains a lot of useful ways to search and filter data.

## Usage

###Convert an object to H5ON

```javascript
var person = {
  name: 'Akosua',
  age: 39
};
var $person = $.h5on( person );
```

###Place H5ON in the DOM for viewing

```javascript
$( 'body' ).append( $person );
```

It's recommended that you use CSS (such as the included h5on.css) to style H5ON elements, otherwise the browser won't know how to render them and it'll come out as a mess of plain text.

###Traverse H5ON using selectors

```javascript
var $age = $person.find( 'h5-value[data-key="age"]' );
```

###Convert H5ON to an object

```javascript
var age = $age.h5on();
```

### Manipulation

You can manipulate the H5ON DOM in the same way you would the standard DOM, using jQuery.

You can create new H5ON elements however you like (provided the syntax is correct), but the easiest way to create them is to use the static helper:

```javascript
var $age = $.h5on( 39 );
```

The plugin expects you to respect the [H5ON syntax](#syntax) and performs no error checking. 

When converting back to a JavaScript object, ``data-`` attributes are ignored, the syntax below explains how H5ON objects are converted to JavaScript objects.

However, changing the H5ON DOM via jQuery means that the auto-generated attributes used for traversal may get out of sync. If you intend to perform selector queries subsequent to editing the DOM, call the h5on method on the jQuery object with the argument ``'reflow'`` to update the attributes:

```javascript
$recentlyModified.h5on( 'reflow' );
```

Another caveat is adding properties to objects, and items to arrays - there are overloads on the static ``$.h5on()`` method for creating these elements:

```javascript
//add a property to an object
$someH5Object.append( $.h5on( { key: 'age', value: 39 }, 'property' ) );

//add an item to an array
$someH5Array.append( $.h5on( 'Hello World', 'item' ) );
```

In both of these cases it is recommend that you use ``'reflow'`` as described above to update the attributes.

Please note that the reflow method brute force rebuilds the entire H5ON DOM, so you will lose any events etc. attached to these elements (pull request welcomed!) - this won't affect you if you instead attach the event to a parent element in the DOM with a selector filter, for example:

```javascript
$( document ).on( 'click', 'h5-object', function(){
//...
});
```

###Mixing HTML and H5ON

The H5ON DOM can contain arbitrary HTML at any point. HTML is converted to and from JavaScript objects using the following syntax:

```javascript
var heading = {
  "tagName": "h1",
  "attr": {
    "style": "color: red;"
  },
  "children": [
    "Hello World"
  ]
};
```

The ``children`` array can contain any mixture of text nodes (as strings), element nodes structured as per above, and H5ON elements - other node types such as comments are not currently supported (pull request welcome!).

## Demos and Examples

### Demos

1. [Interactive selector demo](http://h5on.org/demo.html)
2. [Visual H5ON editor demo](http://h5on.org/editor.html)

### Selector Examples

#### Find all of a specific type
```javascript
//strings
var $strings = $( 'h5-string' );

//objects
var $objects = $( 'h5-object' );

//etc.
```

#### Find all objects that have a certain key
```javascript
var $withWeights = $( 'h5-object:has( > [data-key="Weight"] )' );
```

#### Find all objects with a certain key value pair
```javascript
var $containers = $( 'h5-object:has( > [data-key="Type"][data-value="Container"] )' );
```

#### Find all objects that contain a certain type
```javascript
var $withArrays = $( 'h5-object:has( > [data-type="array"] )' );
```

#### Get all keys
```javascript
var $keys = $( 'h5-key' );
```

#### Get all values
```javascript
var $values = $( 'h5-value' );
```

#### Get all properties
```javascript
var $properties = $( 'h5-property' );
```

Please note that this will convert each property to a key/value pair object:

```javascript
{
  "key": "name",
  "value": "Akosua"
}
```

#### Custom selector expressions

The plugin has the following custom selector expressions:

```css
:valLte( value )
:valLt( value )
:valGte( value )
:valGt( value )
```

For example:

```javascript
var $lightObjects = $( 'h5-object:has( > [data-key="Weight"]:valLt( 500 ) )' )
```

### Coming soon (maybe?)

~~Add jQuery selector extensions to test values, eg :valGt( 4 ), :valGte( 4 ) etc.~~ - done! 

## Why would you want to traverse an object graph with jQuery?

JSON data is an object graph - the [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) is an object graph. 
Many developers are already familiar with using [selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_started/Selectors) to traverse and manipulate the DOM. 
By representing an object graph as [HTML5 custom elements](http://www.w3.org/TR/custom-elements/), you can apply the same techniques you use on the DOM with any data.
The plugin takes a plain (JSON-serializable) JavaScript object as data, and returns H5ON, which is composed of ordinary DOM elements wrapped in a jQuery object which can be traversed and manipulated as usual, and can be placed in a document for viewing.
Calling the H5ON function again on these jQuery objects converts them back to a plain JavaScript object.

In addition, H5ON also maps non-H5ON elements to and from JavaScript objects so that you can mix H5ON and ordinary DOM elements.

### Example - find all objects in the graph which have a property named "Weight":

#### Input
```javascript
{
  "Name": "Akosua",
  "Occupation": "Zombie Hunter",
  "Is Infected": false,
  "Equipment": [
    {
      "Name": "Backpack",
      "Type": "Container",
      "Capacity": 40000,
      "Weight": 2000,
      "Contents": [
        {
          "Name": "Water Bottle",
          "Type": "Container",
          "Capacity": 1000,
          "Weight": 0.2,
          "Contents": [
            {
              "Name": "Water",
              "Weight": 365.9
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "Name": "Necronomicon",
          "Type": "Book",
          "Weight": 0.87
        }
      ]
    },    
    {
      "Name": "Katana",
      "Type": "Weapon",
      "Class": "Edged",
      "Damage": {
        "Base": "4d6",
        "Modifier": -2
      },
      "Weight": 1200
    }
  ]
}
```

#### JavaScript
```javascript
//convert a JavaScript object to H5ON
var $h5Data = $.h5on( input );
//find all objects in the object graph with a key matching "Weight"
var $h5WithWeights = $h5Data.find( 'h5-object:has( > [data-key]="Weight" )' );
//convert the H5ON back to a JavaScript object
var output = $h5WithWeights.h5on();
```

Or, in one line:

```javascript
var output = $.h5on( input ).find( 'h5-object:has( > [data-key]="Weight" )' ).h5on();
```

#### Output
```javascript
[
  {
    "Name": "Backpack",
    "Type": "Container",
    "Capacity": 40000,
    "Weight": 2000,
    "Contents": [
      {
        "Name": "Water Bottle",
        "Type": "Container",
        "Capacity": 1000,
        "Weight": 0.2,
        "Contents": [
          {
            "Name": "Water",
            "Weight": 365.9
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "Name": "Necronomicon",
        "Type": "Book",
        "Weight": 0.87
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "Name": "Water Bottle",
    "Type": "Container",
    "Capacity": 1000,
    "Weight": 0.2,
    "Contents": [
      {
        "Name": "Water",
        "Weight": 365.9
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "Name": "Water",
    "Weight": 365.9
  },
  {
    "Name": "Necronomicon",
    "Type": "Book",
    "Weight": 0.87
  },
  {
    "Name": "Katana",
    "Type": "Weapon",
    "Class": "Edged",
    "Damage": {
      "Base": "4d6",
      "Modifier": -2
    },
    "Weight": 1200
  }
]
```

## What do you mean by human readable?

When we say "human readable", we mean as rendered by a browser's layout engine.
The notation for H5ON is more verbose than would be necessary if it were just a data transport mechanism.
This is because H5ON is richly decorated with attributes and wrapper elements. 
The purpose of this is twofold:

1. Simpler selectors when traversing
2. Displayed meaningfully when rendered
 
### Example of browser rendering, using H5ON generated by the input from the previous example and [h5on.css](h5on.css):

#### Browser rendering
![H5ON](view.png?raw=true)

#### Generated H5ON (note verbosity compared to JSON!)

## Syntax

Like JSON, possible values are:

* number
* string
* boolean
* array
* object
* null

### Primitive Literals

The primitive values are number, string and boolean. The notation for these is:

```html
<h5-{{type}} data-value="{{value}}">{{value}}</h5-{{type}}>
```

This duplication of the value (in both an attribute and as a text node) is a good example of favouring verbosity over compactness to make the data easy to traverse and display.

Note that the attributes are used only for ease of selection. When converting back to an object, the plugin expects this element to contain a single text node only, and the text content of that node is converted to the expected type. No error checking is performed!

### Number

#### H5ON
```html
<h5-number data-value="42">42</h5-number>
```

#### JSON
```javascript
42
```

### String

#### H5ON
```html
<h5-string data-value="Hello World">Hello World</h5-number>
```

#### JSON
```javascript
"Hello World"
```

### Boolean

#### H5ON
```html
<h5-boolean data-value="false">false</h5-boolean>
```

#### JSON
```javascript
false
```

### Array

#### H5ON
```html
<h5-array data-length="3">
  <h5-item data-index="0" data-type="number" data-value="42">
    <h5-number data-value="42">42</h5-number>
  </h5-item>
  <h5-item data-index="1" data-type="string" data-value="Hello World">
    <h5-string data-value="Hello World">Hello World</h5-string>
  </h5-item>
  <h5-item data-index="2" data-type="boolean" data-value="false">
    <h5-boolean data-value="false">false</h5-boolean>
  </h5-item>
</h5-array>
```

#### JSON
```javascript
[ 42, "Hello World", false ]
```

Each array item is wrapped in an <h5-item> element, much like an ordinary list (`<ul><li>` etc.) Again, this is for ease of selection and display.

The attributes are used for selection only - when converting back to an object, the plugin expects an `<h5-array>` to contain only `<h5-item>` elements. The `<h5-item>` element can contain any other element. No error checking is performed!

### Object

#### H5ON
```html
<h5-object data-keys="name age hobby">
  <h5-property data-key="name" data-type="string" data-value="Akosua">
    <h5-key>name</h5-key>
    <h5-value data-key="name" data-type="string" data-value="Akosua">
      <h5-string data-value="Akosua">Akosua</h5-string>    
    </h5-value>
  </h5-property>
  <h5-property data-key="age" data-type="number" data-value="39">
    <h5-key>age</h5-key>
    <h5-value data-key="age" data-type="number" data-value="39">
      <h5-number data-value="39">39</h5-number>
    </h5-value>
  </h5-property>
  <h5-property data-key="hobby" data-type="string" data-value="Hunting zombies">
    <h5-key>hobby</h5-key>
    <h5-value data-key="hobby" data-type="string" data-value="Hunting zombies">
      <h5-string data-value="Hunting zombies">Hunting zombies</h5-string>
    </h5-value>
  </h5-property>
</h5-object>
```

#### JSON
```javascript
{
  "name": "Akosua",
  "age": 39,
  "hobby": "Hunting zombies"
}
```

An object consists of any number of properties, each of which is a key-value pair.

The attributes are used for selection only - when converting back to an object, the plugin expects an `<h5-object>` to contain only `<h5-property>` elements. Each `<h5-property>` element is expected to contain a single `<h5-key>` element and a single `<h5-value>` element. The plugin expected the `<h5-key>` element to contain a single text node and the text content of that node is used as the property's key. The `<h5-value>` element can contain anything. No error checking is performed!

Please note - the object has an attribute, `[data-keys]` which contains a whitespace separated list of keys. Because the list is whitespaced, any keys with a space in them will have their spaces converted to underscores. This allows the use of the [attribute contains word selector](http://api.jquery.com/attribute-contains-word-selector/) to select all objects that have the requested property:

```javascript
var $objectsWithAWidth = $h5Object.find( 'h5-object[data-keys~="Width"]' );
```

If we had a key that contained spaces, we would replace them with underscores when using the **attribute contains word selector**:

```javascript
var $matchingObjects = $h5Object.find( 'h5-object[data-keys~="Key_With_Spaces"]' );
```

In all other cases the normal key with spaces is fine:

```javascript
var $matchingValues = $h5Object.find( 'h5-value[data-key="Key With Spaces"]' );
```

### Null

#### H5ON
```html
<h5-null />
```

#### JSON
```javascript
null
```

## Status

Working prototype - usable, shows what it can do, demonstrates the concept, imperfect. Pull requests welcomed, if it's a simple and obvious bug fix go ahead, but for anything more major please open an issue to discuss first.
